# Hiby Issues

This is an unofficial bug tracker for Hiby OS and Hiby Music for mobile
platforms.

Hiby manufacture digital audio hardware and software. Like all software, Hiby
products contain bugs. In the absence of any official bug tracker from Hiby
themselves, the purpose of this repo is to document bugs (and maybe some
feature requests) for Hiby products (namely Hiby OS and Hiby Music for mobile
platforms).

I want to be clear that this is not intended as an attack on Hiby and their products. Rather, I'd like to help improve the products.

Note that this is *totally unofficial*.

Also note that the author is not employed by Hiby. Since no source code is (or
likely ever will be) published for Hiby products, the community has no power to
fix any of the bugs listed in this repo. It is our hope that Hiby will take
notice of this repo and push software updates to address these issues.
